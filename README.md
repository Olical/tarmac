# Tarmac

Tiny and unopinionated AMD MVC JavaScript framework. Available on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/tarmac).

Built to provide the base functionality required for an MVC application. This means that it assists with things like routing and storage, but needs you to implement the end result. This means it can be used on any JavaScript platform.

If you want to run it in a browser you can hook the router in the hash change event and storage into localStorage. Or maybe you want your storage to fire off to the server to keep things a little safer. It's all up to you.

Views and rendering should be implemented how you think is best for your specific application. Chose a templating library that matches your need at the time.

## Status

This framework is still in development at the moment. You can play with it if you want, the tests will all be passing. Things will just change rapidly and without warning. Use at your own risk!

## Tests

You can run the tests by starting the server (`./scripts/server.sh`) and navigating to [http://localhost:8000/tests/](http://localhost:8000/tests/).
